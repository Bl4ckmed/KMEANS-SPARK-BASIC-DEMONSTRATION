# KMEANS-SPARK-BASIC-DEMONSTRATION 
In this repo, you will find an implementation of a KMEANS model on a spark environment using  SPARK (Pyspark in this case) 
After the implementation of the model, I checked the convergence of the model through applying changes to the K value and the number of maximum iterations and gave an insight about how this value would affect our model
